## BTC Clan Ticker

I am about to launch a new site for bitcoin users, http://www.BTCClan.com/

I made this fork for myself but thought you guys might like it too.
I plan to use this fork to improve the user experience for less technical minded traders. 
I mainly use OS X as my main business is mobile apps.

Also, I am currently focusing on just BTC China as they are doing no fees trading.

Will be releasing on App Store soon.

To make it even easier for people to set limits and be able to pick suggested values based on previous trades, etc.

I will be integrating external charts and other information source to this and then make a iOS companion app.
